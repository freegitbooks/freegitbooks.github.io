-A program is crystallized thought. Sometimes those thoughts are confused. Other times, mistakes are introduced when converting thought into code. Either way, the result is a flawed program.
-
-Flaws in a program are usually called bugs. Bugs can be programmer errors or problems in other systems that the program interacts with. Some bugs are immediately apparent, while others are subtle and might remain hidden in a system for years.
+Flaws in computer programs are usually called _bugs_. It makes programmers feel good to imagine them as little things that just happen to crawl into our work. In reality, of course, we put them there ourselves.
 
-Often, problems surface only when a program encounters a situation that the programmer didn't originally consider. Sometimes such situations are unavoidable. When the user is asked to input their age and types _orange_, this puts our program in a difficult position. The situation has to be anticipated and handled somehow.
+If a program is crystallized thought, you can roughly categorize bugs into those caused by the thoughts being confused, and those caused by mistakes introduced while converting a thought to code. The former type is generally harder to diagnose and fix than the latter.
 
-## Programmer mistakes
+## Language
 
-When it comes to programmer mistakes, our aim is simple. We want to find them and fix them. Such mistakes can range from simple typos that cause the computer to complain as soon as it lays eyes on our program to subtle mistakes in our understanding of the way the program operates, causing incorrect outcomes only in specific situations. Bugs of the latter type can take weeks to diagnose.
+Many mistakes could automatically be pointed out to us by the computer, if it knew enough about what we're trying to do. But here JavaScript's looseness is a hindrance. Its concept of bindings and properties is vague enough that it will rarely catch typos before actually running the program. And even then, it allows you to do some clearly nonsensical things without complaint, such as computing `true * "monkey"`.
 
-The degree to which languages help you find such mistakes varies. Unsurprisingly, JavaScript is at the “hardly helps at all” end of that scale. Some languages want to know the types of all your variables and expressions before even running a program and will tell you right away when a type is used in an inconsistent way. JavaScript considers types only when actually running the program, and even then, it allows you to do some clearly nonsensical things without complaint, such as `x = true * "monkey"`.
+There are some things that JavaScript does complain about. Writing a program that does not follow the language's grammar will immediately make the computer complain. Other things, such as calling something that's not a function or looking up a property on an undefined value, will cause an error to be reported when the program tries to perform the action.
 
-There are some things that JavaScript does complain about, though. Writing a program that is not syntactically valid will immediately trigger an error. Other things, such as calling something that's not a function or looking up a property on an undefined value, will cause an error to be reported when the program is running and encounters the nonsensical action.
-
-But often, your nonsense computation will simply produce a `NaN` (not a number) or undefined value. And the program happily continues, convinced that it's doing something meaningful. The mistake will manifest itself only later, after the bogus value has traveled through several functions. It might not trigger an error at all but silently cause the program's output to be wrong. Finding the source of such problems can be difficult.

-Normally, when you forget to put `var` in front of your variable, as with `counter` in the example, JavaScript quietly creates a global variable and uses that. In strict mode, however, an error is reported instead. This is very helpful. It should be noted, though, that this doesn't work when the variable in question already exists as a global variable, but only when assigning to it would have created it.
+Normally, when you forget to put `let` in front of your binding, as with `counter` in the example, JavaScript quietly creates a global binding and uses that. In strict mode an error is reported instead. This is very helpful. It should be noted, though, that this doesn't work when the binding in question already exists as a global binding. In that case, the loop will still quietly overwrite the value of the binding.
 
-Another change in strict mode is that the `this` binding holds the value `undefined` in functions that are not called as methods. When making such a call outside of strict mode, `this` refers to the global scope object. So if you accidentally call a method or constructor incorrectly in strict mode, JavaScript will produce an error as soon as it tries to read something from `this`, rather than happily working with the global object, creating and reading global variables.

+let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand"); // oops

 We are immediately told that something is wrong. This is helpful.
 
-Strict mode does a few more things. It disallows giving a function multiple parameters with the same name and removes certain problematic language features entirely (such as the `with` statement, which is so misguided it is not further discussed in this book).
+Fortunately, constructors created with the `class` notation will always complain if they are called without `new`, making this less of a problem even in non-strict mode.
 
-In short, putting a `"use strict"` at the top of your program rarely hurts and might help you spot a problem.

-If the language is not going to do much to help us find mistakes, we'll have to find them the hard way: by running the program and seeing whether it does the right thing.
+## Types
 
-Doing this by hand, again and again, is a sure way to drive yourself insane. Fortunately, it is often possible to write a second program that automates testing your actual program.
+Some languages want to know the types of all your bindings and expressions before even running a program. They will tell you right away when a type is used in an inconsistent way. JavaScript considers types only when actually running the program, and even there often tries to implicitly convert values to the type it expects, so it's not much help.
 
-As an example, we once again use the `Vector` type.
+Still, types provide a useful framework for talking about programs. A lot of mistakes come from being confused about the kind of value that goes into or comes out of a function. If you have that information written down, you're less likely to get confused.
+
+You could add a comment like this above the `goalOrientedRobot` function from the last chapter, to describe its type.
 
 ```
-function Vector(x, y) {
-  this.x = x;
-  this.y = y;
+// (WorldState, Array) → {direction: string, memory: Array}
+function goalOrientedRobot(state, memory) {
+  // ...
 }
-Vector.prototype.plus = function(other) {
-  return new Vector(this.x + other.x, this.y + other.y);
-};
 ```
 
-We will write a program to check that our implementation of `Vector` works as intended. Then, every time we change the implementation, we follow up by running the test program so that we can be reasonably confident that we didn't break anything. When we add extra functionality (for example, a new method) to the `Vector` type, we also add tests for the new feature.
+There are a number of different conventions for annotating JavaScript programs with types.
 
-```
-function testVector() {
-  var p1 = new Vector(10, 20);
-  var p2 = new Vector(-10, 5);
-  var p3 = p1.plus(p2);
+One thing about types is that they need to introduce their own complexity to be able to describe enough code to be useful. What do you think would be the type of the `randomPick` function that returns a random element from an array? You'd need to introduce a _type variable_, _T_, which can stand in for any type, so that you can give `randomPick` a type like `([T]) → T` (function from an array of _T_s to a _T_).
+
+When the types of a program are known, it is possible for the computer to _check_ them for you, pointing out mistakes before the program is run. There are several JavaScript dialects that add types to the language and check them. The most popular one is called [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). If you are interested in adding more rigor to your programs, I recommend you give it a try.
+
+In this book, we'll continue using raw, dangerous, untyped JavaScript code.
+
+## Testing
+
+If the language is not going to do much to help us find mistakes, we'll have to find them the hard way: by running the program and seeing whether it does the right thing.
+
+Doing this by hand, again and again, is a really bad idea. Not only is it annoying, it also tends to be ineffective, since it takes too much time to exhaustively test everything every time you make a change.
+
+Computers are good at repetitive tasks, and testing is the ideal repetitive task. Automated testing is the process of writing a program that tests another program. Writing tests is a bit more work than testing manually, but once you've done it you gain a kind of superpower: it only takes you a few seconds to verify that your program still behaves properly in all the situations you wrote tests for. When you break something, you'll immediately notice, rather than randomly running into it at some later time.
 
-  if (p1.x !== 10) return "fail: x property";
-  if (p1.y !== 20) return "fail: y property";
-  if (p2.x !== -10) return "fail: negative x property";
-  if (p3.x !== 0) return "fail: x from plus";
-  if (p3.y !== 25) return "fail: y from plus";
-  return "everything ok";
+Tests usually take the form of little labeled programs that verify some aspect of your code. For example, a set of tests for the (standard, probably already tested by someone else) `toUpperCase` method might look like this:
+
+```
+function test(label, body) {
+  if (!body()) console.log(`Failed: ${label}`);
 }
-console.log(testVector());
-// → everything ok
+
+test("convert Latin text to uppercase", () => {
+  return "hello".toUpperCase() == "HELLO";
+});
+test("convert Greek text to uppercase", () => {
+  return "Χαίρετε".toUpperCase() == "ΧΑΊΡΕΤΕ";
+});
+test("don't convert case-less characters", () => {
+  return "مرحبا".toUpperCase() == "مرحبا";
+});
 ```
 
-Writing tests like this tends to produce rather repetitive, awkward code. Fortunately, there exist pieces of software that help you build and run collections of tests (_test suites_) by providing a language (in the form of functions and methods) suited to expressing tests and by outputting informative information when a test fails. These are called _testing frameworks_.

+Some code is easier to test than other code. Generally, the more external objects that the code interacts with, the harder it is to set up the context in which to test it. The style of programming shown in the [previous chapter](07_robot.html), which uses self-contained persistent values rather than changing objects, tends to be easy to test.

You'll look into the problem and try again. “Real” applications, on the other hand, are expected to not simply crash.

-This is a sound strategy. Now any code that calls `promptNumber` must check whether an actual number was read and, failing that, must somehow recover—maybe by asking again or by filling in a default value.

It does, however, have its downsides. First, what if the function can already return every possible kind of value? In such a function, you'll have to do something like wrap the result in an object to be able to distinguish success from failure.

-The second issue with returning special values is that it can lead to some very cluttered code. If a piece of code calls `promptNumber` 10 times, it has to check 10 times whether `null` was returned. And if its response to finding `null` is to simply return `null` itself, the caller will in turn have to check for it, and so on.

This is called _unwinding the stack_. You may remember the stack of function calls that was mentioned in [Chapter 3](03_functions.html#stack). An exception zooms down this stack, throwing away all the call contexts it encounters.

Their power lies in the fact that you can set “obstacles” along the stack to _catch_ the exception as it is zooming down.

 ## Cleaning up after exceptions
 
-Consider the following situation: a function, `withContext`, wants to make sure that, during its execution, the top-level variable `context` holds a specific context value. After it finishes, it restores this variable to its old value.
+The effect of an exception is another kind of control flow. Every action that might cause an exception, which is pretty much every function call and property access, might cause control to suddenly leave your code.
+
+That means that when code has several side effects, even if its “regular” control flow looks like they'll always all happen, an exception might prevent some of them from taking place.
+
+Here is some really bad banking code.

+  b: 0,
+  c: 20

-  context = oldContext;
-  return result;

+}

+  if (accounts[from] < amount) return;
+  accounts[from] -= amount;
+  accounts[getAccount()] += amount;
 }
 ```
 
-What if `body` raises an exception? In that case, the call to `withContext` will be thrown off the stack by the exception, and `context` will never be set back to its old value.
+The `transfer` function transfers a sum of money from a given account to another, asking for the name of the other account in the process. If given an invalid account name, `getAccount` throws an exception.
+
+But `transfer` _first_ removes the money from the account, and _then_ calls `getAccount` before it adds it to another account. If it is broken off by an exception at that point, it'll just make the money disappear.
+
+That code could have been written a little more intelligently, for example by calling `getAccount` before it starts moving money around. But often problems like this occur in more subtle ways. Even functions that don't look like they will throw an exception might do so in exceptional circumstances or when they contain a programmer mistake.
 
-There is one more feature that `try` statements have. They may be followed by a `finally` block either instead of or in addition to a `catch` block. A `finally` block means “No matter _what_ happens, run this code after trying to run the code in the `try` block”. If a function has to clean something up, the cleanup code should usually be put into a `finally` block.
+One way to address this is to use fewer side effects. Again, a programming style that computes new values instead of changing existing data helps. If a piece of code stops running in the middle of creating a new value, no one ever sees the half-finished value, and there is no problem.
+
+But that isn't always practical. So there is another feature that `try` statements have. They may be followed by a `finally` block either instead of or in addition to a `catch` block. A `finally` block says “no matter _what_ happens, run this code after trying to run the code in the `try` block.”
 
 ```
-function withContext(newContext, body) {
-  var oldContext = context;
-  context = newContext;
+function transfer(from, amount) {
+  if (accounts[from] < amount) return;
+  let progress = 0;
   try {
-    return body();
+    accounts[from] -= amount;
+    progress = 1;
+    accounts[getAccount()] += amount;
+    progress = 2;
   } finally {
-    context = oldContext;
+    if (progress == 1) {
+      accounts[from] += amount;
+    }
   }
 }
 ```
 
-Note that we no longer have to store the result of `body` (which we want to return) in a variable. Even if we return directly from the `try` block, the `finally` block will be run. Now we can do this and be safe:
-
-```
-try {
-  withContext(5, function() {
-    if (context < 10)
-      throw new Error("Not enough context!");
-  });
-} catch (e) {
-  console.log("Ignoring: " + e);
-}
-// → Ignoring: Error: Not enough context!
+This version of the function tracks its progress, and if, when leaving, it notices that it was aborted at a point where it had created an inconsistent program state, it repairs the damage it did.
 
-console.log(context);
-// → null
-```
+Note that, even though the `finally` code is run when an exception leaves the `try` block, it does not interfere with the exception. After the `finally` block runs, the stack continues unwinding.
 
-Even though the function called from `withContext` exploded, `withContext` itself still properly cleaned up the `context` variable.
+Writing programs that operate reliably even when exceptions pop up in unexpected places is very hard. Many people simply don't bother, and because exceptions are typically reserved for exceptional circumstances, the problem may occur so rarely that it is never even noticed. Whether that is a good thing or a really bad thing depends on how much damage the software will do when it fails.
 
 ## Selective catching
 
-When an exception makes it all the way to the bottom of the stack without being caught, it gets handled by the environment. What this means differs between environments. In browsers, a description of the error typically gets written to the JavaScript console (reachable through the browser's Tools or Developer menu).

In browsers, a description of the error typically gets written to the JavaScript console (reachable through the browser's Tools or Developer menu). Node.js, the browserless JavaScript environment we will discuss in [Chapter 20](20_node.html), is more careful about data corruption. It aborts the whole process when an unhandled exception occurs.
 
-For programmer mistakes or problems that the program cannot possibly handle, just letting the error go through is often okay. An unhandled exception is a reasonable way to signal a broken program, and the JavaScript console will, on modern browsers, provide you with some information about which function calls were on the stack when the problem occurred.

As soon as someone changes (or translates) the message, the code will stop working.
 
 Rather, let's define a new type of error and use `instanceof` to identify it.
 
 ```
-function InputError(message) {
-  this.message = message;
-  this.stack = (new Error()).stack;
-}
-InputError.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype);
-InputError.prototype.name = "InputError";
-```
-
-The prototype is made to derive from `Error.prototype` so that `instanceof Error` will also return true for `InputError` objects. It's also given a `name` property since the standard error types (`Error`, `SyntaxError`, `ReferenceError`, and so on) also have such a property.
-
-The assignment to the `stack` property tries to give this object a somewhat useful stack trace, on platforms that support it, by creating a regular error object and then using that object's `stack` property as its own.
-
-Now `promptDirection` can throw such an error.
+class InputError extends Error {}
 
-```
 function promptDirection(question) {
-  var result = prompt(question, "");
+  let result = prompt(question);
   if (result.toLowerCase() == "left") return "L";
   if (result.toLowerCase() == "right") return "R";
   throw new InputError("Invalid direction: " + result);
 }
 ```
 
-And the loop can catch it more carefully.
+The new error class extends `Error`. It doesn't define its own constructor, which means that it inherits the `Error` constructor, which expects a string message as argument. In fact, it doesn't define anything at all—the class is empty. `InputError` objects behave like `Error` objects, except that they have a different class by which we can recognize them.
+
+Now the loop can catch these more carefully.
 
 ```
 for (;;) {
   try {
-    var dir = promptDirection("Where?");
+    let dir = promptDirection("Where?");
     console.log("You chose ", dir);
     break;
   } catch (e) {
-    if (e instanceof InputError)
+    if (e instanceof InputError) {
       console.log("Not a valid direction. Try again.");
-    else
+    } else {
       throw e;
+    }
   }
 }
 ```
 
-This will catch only instances of `InputError` and let unrelated exceptions through. If you reintroduce the typo, the undefined variable error will be properly reported.

 ## Assertions
 
-_Assertions_ are a tool to do basic sanity checking for programmer errors. Consider this helper function, `assert`:
+_Assertions_ are checks inside a program that verify that something is the way it is supposed to be. They are used not to handle situations that can come up in normal operation, but to find programmer mistakes.
 
-```
-function AssertionFailed(message) {
-  this.message = message;
-}
-AssertionFailed.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype);
+If, for example, `firstElement` is described as a function that should never be called on empty arrays, we might write it like this:
 
-function assert(test, message) {
-  if (!test)
-    throw new AssertionFailed(message);
-}
-
-function lastElement(array) {
-  assert(array.length > 0, "empty array in lastElement");
-  return array[array.length - 1];
+```
+function firstElement(array) {
+  if (array.length == 0) {
+    throw new Error("firstElement called with []");
+  }
+  return array[0];
 }
 ```
 
-This provides a compact way to enforce expectations, helpfully blowing up the program if the stated condition does not hold. For instance, the `lastElement` function, which fetches the last element from an array, would return `undefined` on empty arrays if the assertion was omitted. Fetching the last element from an empty array does not make much sense, so it is almost certainly a programmer error to do so.
+Now, instead of silently returning undefined (which you get when reading an array property that does not exist), this will loudly blow up your program as soon as you misuse it. This makes it less likely for such mistakes to go unnoticed, and easier to find their cause when they occur.
 
-Assertions are a way to make sure mistakes cause failures at the point of the mistake, rather than silently producing nonsense values that may go on to cause trouble in an unrelated part of the system.
+I do not recommend trying to write assertions for every possible kind of bad input. That'd be a lot of work and would lead to very noisy code. You'll want to reserve them for mistakes that are easy to make (or that you find yourself making).
 
 ## Summary
 
-Mistakes and bad input are facts of life. Bugs in programs need to be found and fixed. They can become easier to notice by having automated test suites and adding assertions to your programs.

-Throwing an exception causes the call stack to be unwound until the next enclosing `try/catch` block or until the bottom of the stack. The exception value will be given to the `catch` block that catches it, which should verify that it is actually the expected kind of exception and then do something with it. To deal with the unpredictable control flow caused by exceptions, `finally` blocks can be used to ensure a piece of code is _always_ run when a block finishes.
