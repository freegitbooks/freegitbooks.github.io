 Building your own programming language is surprisingly easy (as long as you do not aim too high) and very enlightening.
 
-The main thing I want to show in this chapter is that there is no magic involved in building your own language. I've often felt that some human inventions were so immensely clever and complicated that I'd never be able to understand them. But with a little reading and tinkering, such things often turn out to be quite mundane.

 ## Parsing
 
-The most immediately visible part of a programming language is its _syntax_, or notation. A _parser_ is a program that reads a piece of text and produces a data structure that reflects the structure of the program contained in that text. If the text does not form a valid program, the parser should complain and point out the error.

A number is a sequence of digits. Variable names can consist of any character that is not whitespace and does not have a special meaning in the syntax.

 Contrast this to the parser we wrote for the configuration file format in [Chapter 9](09_regexp.html#ini), which had a simple structure: it split the input into lines and handled those lines one at a time. There were only a few simple forms that a line was allowed to have.

+Fortunately, this problem can be solved very well by writing a parser function that is recursive in a way that reflects the recursive nature of the language.
 
 We define a function `parseExpression`, which takes a string as input and returns an object containing the data structure for the expression at the start of the string, along with the part of the string left after parsing this expression. When parsing subexpressions (the argument to an application, for example), this function can be called again, yielding the argument expression as well as the text that remains. This text may in turn contain more arguments or may be the closing parenthesis that ends the list of arguments.

 What we have built is an interpreter. During evaluation, it acts directly on the representation of the program produced by the parser.
 
-_Compilation_ is the process of adding another step between the parsing and the running of a program, which transforms the program into something that can be evaluated more efficiently by doing as much work as possible in advance. For example, in well-designed languages it is obvious, for each use of a variable, which variable is being referred to, without actually running the program. This can be used to avoid looking up the variable by name every time it is accessed and to directly fetch it from some predetermined memory location.

 ### Arrays
 
-Add support for arrays to Egg by adding the following three functions to the top scope: `array(...)` to construct an array containing the argument values, `length(array)` to get an array's length, and `element(array, n)` to fetch the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element from an array.

 The easiest way to do this is to represent Egg arrays with JavaScript arrays.
 
-The values added to the top environment must be functions. `Array.prototype.slice` can be used to convert an `arguments` array-like object into a regular array.
+The values added to the top scope must be functions. By using a rest argument (with triple-dot notation), the definition of `array` can be _very_ simple.
 
 ### Closure
 
-The way we have defined `fun` allows functions in Egg to “close over” the surrounding environment, allowing the function's body to use local values that were visible at the time the function was defined, just like JavaScript functions do.

 Go back to the definition of the `fun` form and explain which mechanism causes this to work.
 
-Again, we are riding along on a JavaScript mechanism to get the equivalent feature in Egg. Special forms are passed the local environment in which they are evaluated so that they can evaluate their subforms in that environment. The function returned by `fun` closes over the `env` argument given to its enclosing function and uses that to create the function's local environment when it is called.

-This means that the prototype of the local environment will be the environment in which the function was created, which makes it possible to access variables in that environment from the function. This is all there is to implementing closure (though to compile it in a way that is actually efficient, you'd need to do some more work).

 ### Comments
 
 It would be nice if we could write comments in Egg. For example, whenever we find a hash sign (`#`), we could treat the rest of the line as a comment and ignore it, similar to `//` in JavaScript.
 
-We do not have to make any big changes to the parser to support this. We can simply change `skipSpace` to skip comments like they are whitespace so that all the points where `skipSpace` is called will now also skip comments. Make this change.
